           <p>Paladin is a tank job that uses a sword and shield and has strong burst damage as well as many ranged attacks. It also offers a powerful set of targeted and raid-wide mitigation tools for a raid and trial setting. On the defensive side, Paladin has access to powerful raid mitigation and single-target mitigation tools, able to significantly lighten the load on healers in raids and trials, as well as fill the gaps in your co-tank's defenses. It also has access to unique run-saving tools in Clemency and Cover. </p>

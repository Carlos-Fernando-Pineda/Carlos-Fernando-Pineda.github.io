           <p>Warriors are one of four tanks found in FFXIV, wielding a massive greataxe, as well as an extremely potent series of healing spells that allow them to comfortably regain lost health.
            Warrior's core gameplay consists of building up your Beast Gauge with actions, to then unleash powerful, resource-spending moves that deal large amounts of damage to your enemies. With the use of actions such as Inner Release, you can chain together windows of large amounts of damage output, as well as keep yourself healthy and topped-off with a number of defensive and healing actions, such as Bloodwhetting. </p>
